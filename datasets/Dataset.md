## Holistic Coverage and Faithfulness Evaluation of Large Vision-Language Models

* For objects and relations, you need to download [GQA](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/dorarad/gqa/download.html) dataset first. Next, you can extract the images with ids in: 
    * `../human_annotation/object_existence.jsonl`
    * `../human_annotation/relation_comparative.jsonl`
    * `../human_annotation/relation_positional.jsonl`

* For attributes, you can download the images here: `../datasets/attribute/download.txt`
